This was my first true project, sadly though it's going to stop working, I'll be changing my username and as such the hard coded <a> links will all break.
I used to link separate webpages by making a brand new repo, making the page an index.html and uploading that to github pages, and link that here. But now once I change my username, this will all break...
This code was... *horrible* and there's no denying that from me, though the memories of working so hard and having a f*ckass 4,000 line ProccesssingJS Mario Game be inlined into the webpage code won't be gone
If you're reading this, thank you for even caring about looking through this, but just know all projects from here are all from my begginer days.
